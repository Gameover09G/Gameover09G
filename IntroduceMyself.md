- 👋 Hi, I’m Gerard, but everyone calls me @Gameover09G
- 👀 I’m interested in making some games with UNITY and shearing all the scrips that i'll be creating
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 2 programming languages, Python and C#, and probably C++ in the future
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity projects because i love helping people and working in teams, but this in a few years, i'm just starting my programing lessons
- 📫 I'm actualy not interested in people sending e-mails to me if they need something or things like that
